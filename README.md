Welcome to the reboot of CounQER - a question answering system for COUNting Quantifiers and Entity-valued pRedicates.

### Installation
1. Local machine
   
   To run the system in your local machine, start a simple HTTPS server and run it on port 9000. This is where the app will access data files. Type the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` on the command line to get it running. On another terminal start the flask app using the following lines of code. 
```
cd ~/flask_app
python counqer.py
```

2. Server setup

   You can also run this app on a web server. Install apache and configure the server. CounQER is already configured with the mod WSGI file. Make necessary changes in the `server edits` sections of the code to replace the paths with your server paths.
   The app is enables by the command 'apache2 a2ensite <yuor-server>'
